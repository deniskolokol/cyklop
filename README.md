# Cyklop

Inspired by the Cyklop (from "Niezwićiężony" by Stanisław Lem): an 80-ton, self-propelled and self-steering, unmanned armored vehicle equipped with a full arsenal of weapons, including an antimatter launcher.

A SuperCollider project exploring:
- **Wavetable synthesis**  
- **Drum synthesis**  
- **Pattern-based scheduling**  

This repository contains all the code for a musical piece, structured into two main files:  

- `synthdef.scd` – Synth definitions for synthesis  
- `main.scd` – Infrastructure setup (buses, synths) and pattern playback  

A learning-focused project diving into sound design using primarily wavetable synthesis, drum synthesis and rhythmic organization in SuperCollider.
